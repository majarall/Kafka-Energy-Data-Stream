 Create an application that reads data from the API in realtime and generates aggregated values for the last 5 minutes every minute.

 1) Read data from API in realtime -> use the requests library to make HTTP requests to the API endpoint.
 2) Once the data is received we can use streaming processing library. The library can be used to aggregate data over the last 5 minutes and generate the required output. 
 3) Select the data fields that needs to be aggregated(avg, sum, count)
 4) Present the data in a suitable format, dashbord or a report. 
 5) Deploy and Monitor: Deploy the application to a suitable environment, such as a server or cloud platform. Set up monitoring and logging mechanisms. 

 ## Things to remember
 - Handling of authentication of the API's endpoint. This can be stored in a config file in python
